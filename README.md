# indigo

A to-do list managed via the command line, aimed as an alternative to handwriting and elaborate software.

For those quick meetings: instead of writing too slow with those fast-speaking individuals, you can type quick. Or if you're like me and your handwriting is too difficult to understand afterwards.

indigo now stores your tasks, remeber to exit (`n`) to save them! Please **note**: as I am not an expert, the script may not save tasks if there is a user error.
